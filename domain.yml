  utter_report_side_effects:
  - text: "You should consider calling the facility and reporting the side effects."

  utter_treatment_regiment:
  - text: |-
      To access detailed information about your treatment, follow these steps:
      
      1. Open the treatment application on your device.
      2. Navigate to your treatment profile within the application.
      3. You should find comprehensive information about your treatment regimen there, including dosage instructions, frequency, and any additional guidelines.
      
      If you have any further questions or need more personalized guidance, don't hesitate to reach out to your treatment provider at the facility. They are available to educate and assist you throughout your treatment journey.

  utter_stable_client:
  - text: |-
      A stable client refers to a person living with HIV who is on Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) and demonstrates good adherence to their medication. As a stable client, you do not require frequent clinical consultations.


  utter_visit_frequency:
  - text: |-
      For clients who are stable, a differentiated care model is often implemented. Under this model, they typically attend clinical consultations every 6 months.


  utter_viral_load_meaning:
  - text: |-
      Viral load refers to the amount of virus present in your body. It is measured in copies per milliliter (cp/ml).
      
      A high viral load indicates a significant amount of the virus in your body. This means the results show a value higher than 836 cp/ml.
      
      On the other hand, a low detectable viral load (LDL VL) refers to results with a number less than 800 cp/ml. It suggests a lower amount of the virus present.


  utter_suppressed_vs_undetectable_viral_load:
  - text: |-
      When we talk about a suppressed viral load, it means that the results show a value under the 800 cp/ml mark. This is similar to a low detectable viral load (LDL), indicating that the amount of virus in your blood is kept below that threshold.
      
      On the other hand, an undetectable viral load means that the HIV virus in your blood is at an extremely low level. It's so low that it cannot be reliably measured using the available tests. However, it's important to note that even though it's undetectable, it doesn't mean the virus is completely gone from your body.

  utter_baby_dependant_eid:
  - text: "You should visit the facility ,so that they can be immediately get started on Art treatment."


  utter_vl_sample_frequency:
  - text: |-
      The frequency of viral load sample collection depends on your stability as a client. Typically, for stable clients, it is recommended to have a viral load test every 3 months.
      
      However, for clients who may be facing challenges with medication adherence or experiencing instability, the treatment provider will provide guidance on the appropriate frequency based on your individual circumstances and how well you are adhering to taking your medication.
